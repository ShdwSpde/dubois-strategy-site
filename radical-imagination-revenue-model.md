# Radical Imagination — Revenue Model
## A Cultural Technology Studio

---

## THE CORE INSIGHT

Revenue compounds with every figure added to the platform. Du Bois generates revenue from 3 products. Du Bois + Ida B. Wells generates revenue from 6. By the time 5 figures are on the platform, there are 15 products generating revenue — and every institutional headset ships with the full library.

## REVENUE STREAMS (5)

### 1. Content Licensing — Institutional Subscriptions
**The anchor revenue stream.**

Universities, museums, K-12 districts, and cultural centers pay annual licenses to access the platform's living archives, interactive lessons, and VR experiences.

| | Y1 (Du Bois only) | Y2 (+Wells) | Y3 (+Douglass) | Y4 (+Fela) | Y5 (+Fanon, Garvey) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Institutions** | 10 | 35 | 80 | 150 | 280 |
| **Avg license** | $2,000 | $3,500 | $5,000 | $6,500 | $8,000 |
| **Revenue** | **$20K** | **$122K** | **$400K** | **$975K** | **$2.24M** |

**Methodology:**
- Y1 baseline: 10 institutions at $2,000/yr (intro pricing, single-figure access)
- License price increases as library grows — 2 figures = $3,500, 3+ = $5,000–$8,000
- Pricing benchmarked against: Kanopy ($5K–$15K/yr for university streaming), JSTOR ($3K–$20K/yr), Labster VR ($5K–$10K/yr per institution)
- HBCU licenses remain free (subsidized by paid licenses, grants, and sponsorships)
- Pipeline: 107 HBCUs (free), ~4,000 US colleges/universities, ~35,000 museums, ~130,000 K-12 schools — penetration needed is <0.3%

### 2. Pre-loaded Headset Sales
**Hardware revenue with recurring content value.**

VR headsets pre-loaded with the full Radical Imagination library, sold to institutions, libraries, and individual buyers.

| | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Units sold** | 50 | 200 | 600 | 1,500 | 3,500 |
| **Avg price** | $700 | $750 | $800 | $850 | $900 |
| **Revenue** | **$35K** | **$150K** | **$480K** | **$1.28M** | **$3.15M** |

**Methodology:**
- Explorer ($600): individual buyers, small libraries
- Scholar ($1,000): classrooms, single-department installs
- Institution ($1,200): fleet packages for museums, school districts
- Blended average starts at $700, rises as institutional/fleet orders dominate
- Hardware margin: 35–45% after COGS (headset wholesale ~$350–$450, content loading, packaging, support)
- Key driver: library size. A headset with 1 figure is a novelty. A headset with 5 figures is a curriculum.

### 3. Course Fees — VR Creator Training
**Tuition-based revenue from training programs.**

12-week intensive VR courses teaching immersive content creation, focused on cultural heritage applications. Virtual and in-person cohorts.

| | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cohorts** | 1 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 |
| **Students/cohort** | 8 | 12 | 15 | 18 | 20 |
| **Avg tuition** | $1,200 | $1,500 | $2,000 | $2,500 | $3,000 |
| **Revenue** | **$9.6K** | **$36K** | **$120K** | **$270K** | **$480K** |

**Methodology:**
- Y1: single pilot cohort, discounted tuition, virtual delivery
- Y2+: add in-person cohorts (Accra via Wi-Flix studios under Immersive Africa), corporate/professional tracks
- Tuition benchmarked against: General Assembly ($14K–$15K for 12-week bootcamp), Coursera professional certs ($2K–$5K), Africa-based tech bootcamps ($500–$2,000)
- Radical Imagination pricing is mid-market, reflecting both quality and accessibility
- Scholarship slots funded separately (grants, direct support tiers)

### 4. Grants & Fellowships
**Catalytic funding that tapers as earned revenue grows.**

Foundation grants, government arts/education funding, and fellowship awards.

| | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Revenue** | **$75K** | **$150K** | **$200K** | **$150K** | **$100K** |

**Methodology:**
- Y1: Camelback ($50K) + 1 small arts/tech grant ($25K)
- Y2: IMLS, NEH, or Knight Foundation ($100K range) + smaller grants
- Y3 peak: larger institutional grants as platform proves model with 3 figures
- Y4–Y5 taper: earned revenue exceeds grant dependency. Grants shift from general operating to specific expansion (new figures, new geographies)
- Grant pipeline: IMLS (National Leadership Grants, $50K–$500K), NEH (Digital Humanities, $50K–$350K), Knight Foundation (Arts + Tech), Mellon Foundation (Higher Learning), Ford Foundation (Creativity & Free Expression)

### 5. Direct Support & Sponsorships
**Tax-deductible contributions + institutional sponsorship packages.**

Individual donors (via Fractured Atlas 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship) and institutional sponsors seeking branded association.

| | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Individual donations** | $15K | $40K | $80K | $120K | $180K |
| **Institutional sponsors** | $0 | $50K | $150K | $300K | $500K |
| **Total** | **$15K** | **$90K** | **$230K** | **$420K** | **$680K** |

**Methodology:**
- Individual: $10K–$25K support tiers (Installation Sponsor, Creator Scholarship, Studio Access) + smaller donations
- Institutional: Y2+ as platform gains visibility. Tiered packages ($25K–$250K) offering branded VR installations, named scholarships, co-branded content
- Sponsor pipeline: tech companies (Meta, Google Arts & Culture), diaspora organizations, HBCU alumni associations, museum networks
- All donations tax-deductible through Fractured Atlas

## UNIT ECONOMICS PER FIGURE

Once the architecture is proven (Du Bois), each additional figure costs significantly less:

| Cost Category | Figure 1 (Du Bois) | Figures 2–3 | Figures 4+ |
|---|---|---|---|
| RAG archive build | $15K | $10K | $8K |
| VR experience production | $20K | $15K | $12K |
| Interactive lessons | $10K | $8K | $6K |
| Research & content acquisition | $5K | $4K | $3K |
| **Total build cost** | **$50K** | **$37K** | **$29K** |
| | | | |
| *Time to build* | *6 months* | *3–4 months* | *2–3 months* |

**Why costs drop:**
- Same RAG architecture — no new infrastructure, just new content ingestion
- Same WebXR framework — new scenes, not new engine
- Same curriculum template — new subject matter, same pedagogical framework
- Team learning curve — each build is faster than the last

**Break-even per figure:** At $37K build cost (Figures 2–3), a new figure breaks even when it adds ~15 institutional licenses at $2,500/yr = $37.5K. This happens within Y1 of that figure's launch.

## KEY ASSUMPTIONS & RISKS

**Assumptions:**
- Library growth is the primary driver of institutional license value and headset sales
- HBCU free licenses are loss leaders that drive awareness, case studies, and grant eligibility
- Wi-Flix partnership (Immersive Africa) operates as a parallel revenue track for the Nkrumah/Africa-specific work — not double-counted here
- Course fees scale with cohort size and geographic expansion (virtual → in-person)

**Risks & mitigations:**
- **Slow institutional adoption**: Mitigated by free HBCU licenses creating case studies, and by the compound effect of a growing library
- **Grant dependency in Y1**: Mitigated by low burn rate ($155K total) and Camelback's $50K covering a meaningful portion
- **VR headset market shifts**: Mitigated by WebXR browser-based delivery — our VR experiences work without our headsets
- **Content quality at scale**: Mitigated by the repeatable architecture — each build follows the same proven pipeline

## COMPARISON: RADICAL IMAGINATION vs. IMMERSIVE AFRICA

| | Radical Imagination | Immersive Africa |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Platform across diaspora figures | Du Bois + Nkrumah in Accra |
| **Partner** | Independent (Fractured Atlas fiscal sponsor) | Wi-Flix collaborative |
| **Geography** | Global (US-first, then international) | Ghana/Africa-first |
| **Revenue focus** | Licensing, headsets, courses | Ticketing, sponsorship, franchise |
| **Y5 revenue** | $6.65M | $28.6M |
| **Figures covered** | 6 by Y5 | 2 (Du Bois + Nkrumah) |
| **Overlap** | Du Bois products shared | Du Bois products shared |

These are **complementary, not competing** models. Radical Imagination builds the content and technology platform. Immersive Africa handles the physical site revitalization, on-the-ground tourism, and continental distribution via Wi-Flix. Revenue from shared Du Bois products flows to both based on channel (licensing/headsets → RI, ticketing/tours → IA).

## THE COMPOUND STORY

| Milestone | What It Unlocks |
|---|---|
| **Du Bois live** (now) | Proof of concept. Grant eligibility. First institutional licenses. |
| **Ida B. Wells live** (Y1) | Model is replicable. Library has 2 figures. Headsets become a curriculum, not a novelty. |
| **Frederick Douglass live** (Y2) | Three figures = critical mass for institutional subscription pricing. Cedar Hill partnership potential. |
| **Fela Kuti live** (Y3) | First non-US figure in RI pipeline. New Afrika Shrine partnership. Music + visual art expands the content type. |
| **5+ figures** (Y4–Y5) | Platform flywheel. Content library is defensible. Institutional renewal rates climb. Headset is a library, not a device. |
