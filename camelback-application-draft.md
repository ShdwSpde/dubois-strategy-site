### THE PROBLEM

**What problem does your venture address?**

Africa's cultural and intellectual heritage faces a triple crisis.

First, the physical sites are deteriorating. The Du Bois Centre in Accra — where W.E.B. Du Bois spent his final years — needs significant revitalization. Frederick Douglass's Cedar Hill in Washington DC is a National Historic Site, but no immersive digital experience exists. Ida B. Wells's legacy has no dedicated interactive archive. These are not niche figures. They shaped the intellectual and political trajectory of the entire diaspora, and their material heritage is one budget cut away from irrelevance.

Second, the knowledge is scattered and inaccessible. Du Bois published 27 major works. Douglass wrote three autobiographies. Wells produced groundbreaking investigative journalism. Fanon wrote four books that rewired the decolonization movement. Their papers sit in archives across three continents — UMass Amherst, the Schomburg Center, the Library of Congress, Howard University. No unified digital platform exists to make these works searchable, interactive, or teachable. A student in Atlanta and a student in Accra face the same problem: they cannot engage with this material in any modern, immersive, or interactive way.

Third, the immersive technology boom is bypassing diaspora content entirely. The global VR/AR education market is projected to reach $22.5B by 2030. Location-based immersive entertainment will hit $25.9B. But there is not a single high-quality VR experience of the Du Bois Centre, Cedar Hill, or any major Pan-African heritage site. The technology exists. The content does not. And the creators who could build it — young Africans and diaspora makers — face a 70% skills gap in the creative economy, according to a joint African Union/African Development Bank study.

The result: a generation is growing up without immersive access to its own intellectual tradition, while the global immersive market grows without African content, and the physical sites that anchor this heritage are underfunded and undervisited.

### THE SOLUTION

**How does your venture solve this problem?**

Radical Imagination is a cultural technology studio that transforms the scattered legacies of African and diaspora intellectual giants into living digital platforms. We build three products for each figure we take on:

1. **Interactive Lessons & Virtual Archives** — AI-powered living archives (using retrieval-augmented generation) that make an author's complete published works searchable, conversational, and teachable. Paired with interactive curriculum modules for K-12 and university classrooms.

2. **VR/AR Cultural Experiences** — Immersive virtual tours of heritage sites and a VR gallery that translates historical data visualizations and artifacts into explorable 3D environments. Built in WebXR so they run in any browser — no app download required.

3. **Pre-loaded Headsets for Institutions** — VR headsets pre-loaded with our full content library, distributed to HBCUs, museums, cultural centers, and schools. Institutions get a turnkey immersive experience. We get a hardware revenue stream and a distribution channel.

**Du Bois Does Data is our proof of concept** — and it's already built and live. We have a functional [VR gallery](https://dubois-does-data.vercel.app/) (React Three Fiber, WebXR), a [RAG-powered living archive](https://dubois-living-archive.vercel.app/) spanning 17 Du Bois works, and [interactive lesson modules](https://shdwspde.github.io/dubois-does-data-lessons/) including a [Paris Exposition Wrapped](https://shdwspde.github.io/dubois-does-data-lessons/wrapped/) experience. These are not mockups. They are working products you can use right now.

The model is designed to be replicable. Every figure uses the same technical architecture, the same content pipeline, the same three product verticals. After Du Bois, the pipeline includes Ida B. Wells, Frederick Douglass, Fela Kuti, Frantz Fanon, and Marcus Garvey — each with a body of work, heritage sites, and an undertaught legacy. Kwame Nkrumah is a logical next step approached through our Wi-Flix collaborative (Immersive Africa), where the Du Bois–Nkrumah connection in Accra makes him a natural partner for that initiative.

We are not building a one-off documentary. We are building a platform.

### BUSINESS MODEL

**How does your venture generate revenue or sustain itself?**

Radical Imagination operates six revenue streams from day one, with grant dependency tapering to near-zero by Year 4:

1. **Course Fees** — Fee-paying VR creator training courses (12-week intensive, up to 20 participants per cohort). Y1: $320K → Y5: $4.2M.

2. **Ticketing & Tours** — In-person and virtual tours of heritage sites (Du Bois Centre, Nkrumah Memorial). Benchmarked against Nkrumah Memorial Park's 333K annual visitors. Y1: $180K → Y5: $4M.

3. **Sponsorships** — Tiered packages ($10K–$250K) from NGOs, development finance institutions, diaspora organizations, and government agencies. Y1: $400K → Y5: $5M.

4. **Headset Sales** — Pre-loaded VR headsets (Explorer $600, Scholar $1,000, Institution $1,200). Y1: $150K → Y5: $6.5M.

5. **Content Licensing** — Annual licenses for VR experiences and curriculum to museums, universities, and institutions globally. Y1: $50K → Y5: $3.5M.

6. **Franchise Fees** — VR experience center franchise model (launching Y3). Y5: $3.4M.

All projections are built from bottom-up unit economics and triangulated against comparable companies: Fever ($1.8B valuation from touring immersive exhibitions), teamLab (2.5M visitors/year), and Meow Wolf ($80–150M annual revenue).

All donations are tax-deductible through our fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas.

### TARGET POPULATION & EQUITY

**Who does your venture serve, and how does it advance equity?**

We serve four overlapping communities:

1. **Students & professionals** — Aspiring VR creators, digital artists, and educators across Africa and the diaspora who lack formal training in immersive technology. Our training programs directly address the 70% creative economy skills gap.

2. **Cultural enthusiasts & the diaspora** — Heritage tourists, Year of Return travelers, and anyone seeking deeper connection with African intellectual traditions. We make physical sites accessible globally through virtual tours.

3. **Institutions** — HBCUs, museums, K-12 schools, and cultural centers that want to teach African and African American history through immersive, interactive experiences but lack the content and hardware. We provide turnkey solutions and free licenses to all HBCUs.

4. **African creators** — Young creatives in Accra and across the continent who will build the VR experiences themselves, earning income and building skills in a $61B growth market.

**The equity case is structural, not cosmetic.** The immersive technology market is growing at 30%+ annually, and African content is almost entirely absent. We don't just add representation to an existing platform — we build the platform itself, owned and operated by the communities whose stories it tells. Every VR experience is created by African creators. Every archive makes scholarship more accessible, not more expensive. Every headset placed in an HBCU classroom is a free license.

### PERSONAL STORY / WHY YOU

**What drives you to do this work?**

[NOTE: This section should be written in the founder's own voice. Below is a framework — fill in with personal details.]

I started Du Bois Does Data because I kept running into the same gap: the most important intellectual traditions of the African diaspora were either locked in physical archives, taught from photocopied packets, or simply not taught at all. Meanwhile, the immersive technology industry was exploding — and building experiences about everything except us.

I'm a [technologist / designer / educator / builder — insert background]. I've spent [X years] working at the intersection of [relevant experience]. When I built the first VR gallery translating Du Bois's data visualizations into an explorable 3D environment, I realized this wasn't just a cool project — it was a model. The same architecture, the same pipeline, the same approach could work for any figure with a body of work and a story worth telling immersively.

Radical Imagination is what happens when you stop asking "why isn't someone doing this?" and start building it yourself.

### WHY CAMELBACK

**Why are you applying to the Camelback Fellowship specifically?**

Three reasons.

First, Camelback sits at the exact intersection of my two sectors — education and conscious technology. Most funders make me choose one lane. Radical Imagination is both: we build educational technology that is also cultural infrastructure. Camelback is one of the few programs that doesn't force a false choice.

Second, I need coaching more than I need capital. The $50K matters — it funds a full VR installation at an HBCU or a creator scholarship in Accra. But the 1:1 coaching and investor introductions matter more. I have functional products and a clear model. What I need is someone who has seen founders at this stage before and can help me navigate the transition from proof-of-concept to platform.

Third, Camelback's community is the community I want to build alongside. 94% founders of color, 63% women and non-binary. 181+ alumni who have collectively raised over $50M. These are the people who understand that equity isn't a feature — it's the architecture.

## 3-MINUTE VIDEO SCRIPT

### [0:00–0:15] HOOK

"W.E.B. Du Bois published 27 major works. Ida B. Wells wrote the investigative journalism that exposed lynching to the world. Frederick Douglass wrote three autobiographies that changed how America understood slavery. And right now — today — there is not a single immersive digital experience that brings any of it to life. I'm building the one that does."

### [0:15–0:45] WHO I AM + THE PROBLEM

"My name is [Name], and I'm the founder of Radical Imagination — a cultural technology studio creating immersive archives, VR experiences, and interactive curricula for towering figures of the African diaspora.

Here's the problem: the global VR education market will hit $22 billion by 2030. Location-based immersive entertainment, $26 billion. But content about the African diaspora is almost entirely absent. Ida B. Wells's investigative journalism that changed the world — no immersive experience. Frederick Douglass's Cedar Hill — no VR tour. The Du Bois Centre in Accra needs revitalization. The scholarship is scattered across archives on three continents. And 70% of young African creatives lack formal training in the technologies that could change this."

### [0:45–1:30] THE SOLUTION

"Radical Imagination builds three products for every figure we take on.

First: interactive lessons and virtual archives. We use AI to turn an author's complete works into a living, searchable, conversational archive — paired with curriculum modules for classrooms.

Second: VR and AR cultural experiences. Immersive virtual tours of heritage sites, explorable 3D galleries, all built in WebXR so they run in any browser.

Third: pre-loaded headsets for institutions. HBCUs, museums, schools — they get a turnkey VR experience. We get a distribution channel.

Du Bois Does Data is our proof of concept — and it's already built and live. Working VR gallery — you can enter it right now. Living archive across 17 works — ask it a question and get a cited answer. Interactive lessons including a Paris Exposition Wrapped experience. Not a prototype. Functional products, live today."

### [1:30–2:15] THE MODEL + TRACTION

"The key insight is that this model is replicable. Every figure uses the same technical architecture. Du Bois proves it works. The pipeline is deep: Ida B. Wells, Frederick Douglass, Fela Kuti, Frantz Fanon, Marcus Garvey. And through our Wi-Flix collaborative — Immersive Africa — we're approaching Kwame Nkrumah as a logical next step, connecting the Du Bois Centre and Nkrumah Memorial just kilometers apart in Accra. Radical Imagination becomes a platform, not a project.

We generate revenue through six streams: course fees, ticketing, sponsorships, headset sales, content licensing, and franchise fees. We have a forming partnership with Wi-Flix — 4 million customers, studios in Accra, telecom partnerships across the continent. And every donation is tax-deductible through our fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas.

We're not pitching a concept. We're showing you what's already built and asking for support to scale it."

### [2:15–2:50] WHY CAMELBACK + THE ASK

"I'm applying to Camelback because this venture lives at the intersection of education and conscious technology — and Camelback is one of the only programs that understands that intersection. I don't need someone to tell me the idea is good. I need coaching, introductions, and a community of founders who are building at this same edge.

The $50,000 investment funds real things: a VR installation at an HBCU. A creator scholarship in Accra. Studio time to produce the next set of experiences."

### [2:50–3:00] CLOSE

"Du Bois wrote: 'Imagine what might be, if what is, should grow to what we wish.' That's what Radical Imagination does. We take what exists — scattered archives, deteriorating sites, untold stories — and we grow them into what they should have been all along. Thank you."
