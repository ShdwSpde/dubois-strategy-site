### Licensing Comps

| Platform | Price Range | What They Offer |
|---|---|---|
| Labster (VR science labs) | $5,000–$10,000/yr per institution | VR lab simulations for STEM |

## 4. PRE-LOADED HEADSETS

### Product Tiers

| Headset Tier | What's Included | Price | COGS | Margin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Explorer** | 1 headset, full content library, carrying case, quick-start guide | **$600** | $380 | **37%** |
| **Scholar** | 1 headset, full library, lesson plans, teacher guide, classroom stand | **$1,000** | $520 | **48%** |

### COGS Breakdown (Scholar Headset — $1,000)

| Cost Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Headset hardware (Meta Quest 3 or equivalent, wholesale) | $350 |
| Content loading, configuration, QA testing | $40 |
| Carrying case / classroom stand | $25 |
| Lesson plans + teacher guide (print) | $15 |
| Packaging + branded box | $20 |
| Shipping (avg domestic) | $25 |
| Payment processing (3%) | $30 |
| Warranty reserve (2%) | $15 |
| **Total COGS** | **$520** |
| **Gross margin** | **$480 (48%)** |

### The Library Premium

The headset's value grows with every figure added — but the hardware cost stays flat:

| Figures on Platform | Content Depth | Justifiable Price Premium |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (Du Bois) | 3 experiences | Baseline pricing |
| 2 (+ Wells) | 6 experiences | +15% price increase |
| 3 (+ Douglass) | 9 experiences | +25% from baseline |
| 5+ | 15+ experiences | +40% from baseline — it's a library, not a device |

This is why the blended average price rises from $700 (Y1) to $900 (Y5) in the revenue model — the hardware cost doesn't change, but the content justifies premium pricing.

### Content Update Revenue

Every headset sold creates a recurring touchpoint:

| Update Type | Price | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Annual content update (new figures OTA) | **$150/yr** | Annual |
| Premium content pack (special exhibits, limited editions) | **$50–$100** | 2–3x/year |
| Support subscription (tech help, replacement parts) | **$200/yr** | Annual |

## CONSOLIDATED — ALL 4 LINES

| Revenue Line | **Y1** | **Y2** | **Y3** | **Y4** | **Y5** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Content Licensing | $20K | $113K | $386K | $923K | $2,100K |
| Installations | $21K | $91K | $263K | $582K | $1,104K |
| Speaking & Workshops | $27K | $96K | $201K | $350K | $503K |
| Pre-loaded Headsets | $35K | $163K | $565K | $1,495K | $3,620K |
| **Total Earned Revenue** | **$103K** | **$463K** | **$1.42M** | **$3.35M** | **$7.33M** |

### Margin by Line

| Revenue Line | Avg Margin | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Content Licensing | **83%** | Software — scales with near-zero marginal cost per institution |
| Installations | **52%** | Hardware + labor — higher cost but strong upsell to licensing |
| Speaking & Workshops | **74%** | High margin but limited by founder's time; hire facilitators at scale |
| Pre-loaded Headsets | **43%** | Hardware-heavy; margin improves as library premium increases pricing |
| **Blended average** | **~62%** | Shifts toward licensing over time as that line grows fastest |

### Revenue Mix Shift

| | Y1 | Y5 |
|---|---|---|
| Licensing | 19% | 29% |
| Installations | 20% | 15% |
| Speaking | 26% | 7% |
| Headsets | 34% | 49% |
| | | |
| *Highest-margin lines (licensing + speaking)* | *46%* | *35%* |
| *Highest-volume lines (headsets + installs)* | *54%* | *65%* |

Y1 is founder-driven (speaking is the biggest earner). By Y5, product-driven revenue (headsets + licensing) dominates. That's the right trajectory — you're selling products, not your time.
